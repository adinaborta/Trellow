## Integration
I chose to use technologies familiar to me for both the backend and database.

Upon app launch, users are prompted to log in. This authentication process serves one purpose: facilitating board sharing among users. Post-login, users can create an account and access a gallery showcasing their boards. The "Create board" button in the side menu, opens a corresponding form. In the gallery, users can acces one specific board.

To enhance user experience, I've consolidated all board-related information on the main page, covering properties, lists, and cards. These elements are dynamically mapped onto the board page through distinct components like List and Card.

From the main board page, users can seamlessly:

Manage boards by editing, sharing, or deleting them via the settings.
Modify or remove lists directly through the settings of each list.
Dive into each card for a comprehensive view, allowing for content edits or deletions.
